# 100daysofcode-ruby


100 days of code begins! Excited to dive into the Ruby programming language and tackle new challenges.  I will be sharing my progress and challenges along the way on GitHub and social media. Follow my journey as I work towards improving my skills and becoming a better developer and feel free to join me in this challenge or offer your support and encouragement.

Here is a rough outline for a 100-day plan for learning Ruby:


Day 1:

Install Ruby on your computer and set up your development environment.
Go through the Ruby documentation and get familiar with the language syntax and basic concepts.


Day 2-10:

Start working through an online Ruby tutorial or book to get a solid foundation in the language.
Practice writing basic Ruby programs and experimenting with different language features.


Day 11-20:

Learn about object-oriented programming in Ruby.
Practice creating classes and objects, and use inheritance and modules to organize and reuse code.


Day 21-30:

Explore Ruby's built-in libraries and modules.
Learn how to use them to perform common tasks, such as reading and writing files, working with strings and arrays, and parsing command-line arguments.


Day 31-40:

Learn about Ruby's blocks, procs, and lambdas.
Practice using these powerful language features to write more flexible and reusable code.


Day 41-50:

Learn about Ruby's exception-handling mechanism.
Practice handling and raising exceptions in your programs.


Day 51-60:

Explore Ruby's standard library and learn about additional modules and libraries that you can use to perform various tasks.


Day 61-70:

Learn about the Ruby on Rails web framework.
Practice building a simple web application using Rails.


Day 71-80:

Learn about testing in Ruby.
Practice writing unit and integration tests for your programs and applications.


Day 81-90:

Explore more advanced topics in Ruby, such as metaprogramming and concurrency.


Day 91-100:

Choose a project to work on and apply what you have learned to build a real-world application.


This is just a rough outline and will adjust the pace and create more projects too.  


Why am I doing this?

Well, writing functional code is simple (most of the time). But creating code that is effective, succinct, clear, scalable, and maintainable is exceedingly challenging. Along with being fluent in the coding language, it might help to have a lot of experience with different kinds of challenges and paradigms. In order to step outside of my comfort zone and broaden my perspective on the vast field of software development, I made the decision to decide to code every day.


Why Ruby?

Why not Ruby is the proper question. Ruby is stunning from top to bottom, including its name, logo, and syntax. I really like Syntax Sugar, and I find myself missing it while I am programming in another language. In addition, a lot of big players use Ruby, which has a substantial library and a large community (like Github).

So, let's code?

â€“ the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the learning process!
